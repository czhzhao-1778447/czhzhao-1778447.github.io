        <h1>Some CSS Builder (Master)</h1>
        <h2>Level 1</h2>
            <p style="font-family: cursive;">Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
                I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
                In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                So much to do, so much to see
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                You'll never know if you don't go
                You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>
            <p style="font-family: fantasy;">Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
                Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                And all that glitters is gold
                Only shooting stars break the mold
                It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
                You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
                But the meteor men beg to differ
                Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
                The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
                My world's on fire, how about yours?
                That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored</p>

                    border-style: solid;
                    border-color: coral blue pink navy;
                }
            </style>
            <p>the unique command is the multicolor border</p>

            <p id="three">Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

                And all that glitters is gold
                Only shooting stars
                Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
                I need to get myself away from this place
                I said, "Yup" what a concept
                I could use a little fuel myself
                And we could all use a little change
                Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun

                You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
                You'll never shine if you don't glow
                Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
